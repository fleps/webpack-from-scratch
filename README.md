# React + Webpack + Babel

Simple project used to learn how to setup Webpack + Babel to a React project from scratch.

## TIPS
* When using NPM and NPM RUN, the build task should be `"build": "npx webpack --mode production"`, otherwise you will have the error *'wepback' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file.*
* DO NOT try to fix this installing webpack globally, Webpack team strongly recommend to never install it globally (and it will probably not fix it)
